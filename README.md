# Portfolio Optimization

## Precursor
First, this is not financial advice, nor is it investment advice. I did not graduate in finance, nor am I a professional
in the financial sector. I am just a PhD student who likes machine learning, and knows a very little about timeseries.
This project is really just something fun, that I created in ~1 week, that fuses 3 areas I'm good at: 
1. Machine Learning, 2. Math, 3. Programming

## Modern Portfolio Theory
Secondly, I have no idea if this project will ever be useful, especially because we have modern portfolio theory. 
In particular, modern portfolio has what is known as the efficient frontier. This (putting it very briefly) 
is the most optimal portfolio one can have that both minimise the volatility, and maximise the returns of a portfolio.

## Portfolio Optimization
This project is not that. The efficient frontier requires one to be actively buying and selling the shares one owns. I,
on the other hand, have no interest in selling the shares I own. Given my current portfolio, I want it to find how much
of a given stock I should buy to minimise the volatility and maximise returns of the portfolio.



Some understanding of gradient descent would be good, in particular the understanding of epochs, learning rate, and
learning how to see if you have convergence
